    From the Gentoo bug ticket:

    Comment to the patch, since it might look wrong at a first glance:

    All documentation about the return value of XCreateGC I found states
    that it returns a proper pointer and in the error case sets some
    failure stat. In particular, I found no documentation that it
    returns a "negative" pointer.

    The cleanest patch would probably be to check the failure stat, but
    since I am not sure about it, the most reasonable analogous check to
    the original code is to check whether we get a null pointer
    returned. (Very likely, neither the original code nor the patch work
    properly in the error case, but at least the patch fixes the
    compilation issue and causes no regression in the non-error case.)
